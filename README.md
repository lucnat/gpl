## Evaluate G(...) function

Open `src/eval.f90` and modify the line   

```res = GPL(cmplx([1,2,5]))```

This example computes G(1,2,5). Then write

```$ make eval```

```$ ./eval ```

and the result will be printed in standard output. To see what is going on increase verbosity

```$ ./eval -verb 100```

## Test 

Before running it is advised to run the tests

```$ make test```

```$ ./test ```

##Â verbosity legend
10 tell if we need to make convergent
30 give some details about how it is made convergent
50 print whenever G(...) is called
70 print on what polylogs it is reduced
